Some runs for MW working group

Trying turning off LMC/SMC rolling. Might be good for microlensing? Or other LMC/SMC science


request from Jay:  can you run a sim which is like smc_lmc_v3.3_10yrs outside the SCP (so keeps the SMC/LMC filter balance at its new smc_lmc_v3.3_10yrs level) but in the low-visit SCP switches the relative strength of g and r (currently r ~ 30 visits median and g ~ 20 visits, so reverse that). y also has little value here, so if we could reduce y from ~ 15 to ~ 10 visits and give those to g that would also be great.

Removing the template requirement for the SCP region so we can dip below 30 visits per year.
